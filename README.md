# EPRbiodose
Dose reconstruction algorithm using soda-lime glass and EPR spectroscopy in a case of radiological and/or nuclear accidents.
The electron spin resonance (ESR) method is widely used in the field of chemistry, physics,
biology and many interdisciplinary fields, and the application is growing also in the field of
retrospective dosimetry. ESR detection of dosimetric signals originating from radicals induced
under the influence of ionizing radiation allows to determine the dose absorbed by the casualties
following catastrophic, large-scale radiological events. The ESR technique have been applied
to a wide range of radiological studies, including nuclear bomb detonation (e.g., Hiroshima and
Nagasaki), nuclear power plant accidents (e.g., Chernobyl), radioactive pollution (e.g., Mayak
plutonium facility), and in the future could include terrorist events involving the dispersal of
radioactive materials. For retrospective dosimetry, immediate action to evaluate dose to
individuals following radiation exposure is required to assess deterministic biological effects
and to enable rapid medical triage. The triage dose levels are differently defined in the literature
and for purpose of this study triage levels defined in MULTIBIODOSE project have been used.
Low triage dose level is less than 1 Gy when it is unlikely to develop symptoms of acute
radiation syndrome (ARS) and no immediate care is required. The medium level implies doses
1-2 Gy when victim may experience mild or delayed ARS symptoms and follow-up care may
be necessary and high for the doses higher than 2 Gy when moderate to urgent care may be
required.
The retrospective dosimetry measurement techniques aim to perform direct dose evaluations
for individuals who, as members of the public, are most unlikely to be carrying a dosimeter for
radiation monitoring purposes in the event of a radiation incident. Hence attention has focused
on biological or physical materials they may have in their possession that could be used as
surrogate dosimeters. For ESR measurements this includes material within the body (such as
bone or tooth enamel) requiring invasive procedures, a materials collected non-invasively (such
as clippings taken from finger- or toenails) and artefacts within their personal belongings (such
as clothing, fabrics, plastics, glass, sugar, touch screens of mobile phones). The use of electron
spin resonance (ESR) on detection of ionizing radiation-induced radicals in different types of
glasses is a well-established technique in radiation dosimetry.
Nowadays, the float glass is the most widely used form of glass and makes more up to other
types 96% of output. Float soda lime silicate glass is used principally in building and automotive
industries. It is used in various application such as in car glass, windows, doors, sun roofs, copy
